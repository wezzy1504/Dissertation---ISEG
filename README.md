### Hi there 

I am Joel, an Actuarial science graduate at the University of Lisbon (ISEG).
As part of the reqiurement to fuifill my master degree program, I used data from a local insurance firm to estimate outstanding claims and predict future claims.
The purpose was to use the various loss reserving methods to get the best reserves estimates.

I can be reached on this email at joelagbo@aln.iseg.ulisboa.pt for any discussion concerning this work 

Thank you!!
